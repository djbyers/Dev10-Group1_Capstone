Broadly speaking, this project aims to use a variety of and financial factors to forecast different measures of economic and societal well-being. Our data, drawn primarily from the World Bank database, draws upon different measures of government debt, tax revenue, stock value within an economy, inflation, and GDP, among others, to predict values such as poverty, unemployment, wealth disparity, life expectancy, and infant mortality rate.

Using an automated API call from the World Bank, we were able to collect data from every registered country from the years 1990-2020. The goal of our analysis is to be able to produce actionable results by building our models and visualizations to use the data from one country in one particular year to predict whichever dependent variable we choose for the following year in that country. For example, we will use GDP, central government debt, tax revenue, and total value of stocks traded in the United States in 2000 to predict the unemployment rate in the United States in 2001. With this goal in mind, by the end of our process, we should be able to create predictions on a global scale for how these socioeconomic dependent variables will end up at the end of 2021 using the 2020 data.
